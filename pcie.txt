PCI Express (PCIe) is the successor to pci.


PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express), officially
abbreviated as PCIe, is a computer expansion card standard designed to
replace the older PCI, PCI-X, and AGP standards.  Introduced by Intel in
2004, PCIe (or PCI-E, as it is commonly called) is the latest standard 
for expansion cards that is available on mainstream personal computers
[citation needed]

PCI Express is used in consumer, server, and industrial applications, both
as a motherboard-level interconnect (to link motherboard-mounted peripherals)
and as an expansion card interface for add-in boards. A key difference between
PCIe and earlier PC buses is a topology based on point-to-point serial links,
rather than a shared parallel bus architecture.

The PCIe electrical interface is also used in a variety of other standards,
most notably the ExpressCard laptop expansion card interface.

PCIe slots
==========
A connection between any two PCIe devices is known as a "link", and is built up from a 
collection of 1 or more lanes. All devices must minimally support single-lane (x1) link. 
Devices may optionally support wider links composed of 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 32 lanes. This 
allows for very good compatibility in two ways:

* a PCIe card will physically fit (and work correctly) in any slot that is at least as 
large as it is (e.g. an x1 sized card will work in any sized slot);
* a slot of a large physical size (e.g. x16) can be wired electrically with fewer lanes 
(e.g. x1, x4, or x8) as long as it provides the power and ground connections required by the 
larger physical slot size.

The Asus ??? Motherboard has an x4 and x16 PCIe slots.


Filelist
========
AOC-USAS-L8i/    The Supermicro AOC-USAS-L8i *was* a fine looking 8-port 
                 3Gb/s SATA II x8 PCIe card with 2x SFF-8087 connectors.
                 However, turns out it is not PCIe compatible.  Only
                 support Supermicro UIO slots.  Confirmed via email on
